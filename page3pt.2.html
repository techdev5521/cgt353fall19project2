        <p>For example, maybe halfway through drawing the first chapter, you’ll start to think that
          the previous page should have been done differently to make the story more cohesive, or
          maybe there was a visual gag that you just thought of that would have really went well on
          the first page. In that, you’d have to throw out hours of work that could have gone into
          making your comic the best it can be.</p>
