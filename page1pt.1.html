        <p>Now this might be an easier step for some more than others. Some people have one idea
          that they’re dead set on following, while others have dozens of different ideas bouncing
          around in their head that they don’t know what to do with. But in most cases, it’s best to
          stick to one idea and develop it as much as possible. If you’re having trouble picking just
          one, try to narrow them down into the ones you think would make an interesting comic,
          and then narrow it down even further to the best idea.</p>
